# WP CARD VALIDATOR
WordPress Plugin

The present is a simple plugin to provide in the WordPress Admin Area the option to validate the number of a Credit Card, and also check what type of Credit Card it is.

Check "Automatically overwrite this page's content with [property_overview]" or copy and paste [property_overview] into the body of your main property page.
Visit Appearance -> Widgets and set up the widgets you want to show on your different property type pages.
